# Clinical Natural Language Processing Pipeline: Predicting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

This repository contains a Python-based pipeline framework designed for analyzing patient clinical text records and other available data. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to process this information, identify potential risk factors, and ultimately predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a specific **Serious Adverse Event (SAE)** within a predefined future time window.

## Pipeline Core: Processing Clinical Text Information

The framework's ability to effectively utilize clinical note information lies in its powerful **Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline**. This pipeline processes text through a series of structured steps to extract and structure relevant clinical information:

1. **Text Loading and Preprocessing:** Loads raw clinical text data and performs basic cleaning and formatting (e.g., handling special characters, unifying text format).
2. **Basic Linguistic Analysis:** Utilizes established NLP libraries (such as spaCy, transformers, etc.) to perform fundamental linguistic analysis on the text, including tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.
3. **Entity Recognition (NER) / Concept Extraction:** Applies pre-trained models, rules, or dictionary matching to identify and annotate key clinical concepts in the text, such as drug names, disease diagnoses, symptom descriptions, lab results, procedure information, etc.
4. **Rule Matching and Pattern Recognition:** Uses predefined rules or pattern recognition algorithms to identify specific linguistic structures or keyword sequences to capture specific information (e.g., dosage, frequency, severity descriptions).
5. **Contextual Analysis:** Analyzes the context of identified concepts to determine their status (e.g., using negation detection to determine if a symptom is absent: "denies nausea," "no pain") and extract related attributes (e.g., severity level of a symptom, time of onset).
6. **Terminology Standardization:** Maps various ways of referring to the same clinical concept in the text (such as abbreviations, synonyms, different levels of detail, or even common misspellings) to a predefined, standardized clinical terminology system (e.g., using LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, SNOMED CT, or an internal standard dictionary).
7. **Structured Output:** Converts the information extracted, analyzed, and standardized in the preceding steps into a structured format (such as JSON, CSV, or database tables) for use in downstream tasks like feature engineering and machine learning model training.

## Adapting to Real Clinical Application: A Practical Guide

To successfully apply this framework to real-world clinical SAE prediction tasks, it is **essential and critical** to fully configure and customize the pipeline components and downstream models using accurate, domain-specific knowledge tailored to the particular clinical scenario.

> The code configuration provided in this repository is **for demonstration purposes only** and has been **intentionally oversimplified**. It is **not clinically relevant** and **will not** produce clinically meaningful or reliable predictive results on real clinical data.
> 
> Therefore, to transition this framework from a demo to a **potentially usable clinical prediction system**, it **must** be led by professionals with relevant domain expertise (such as clinicians, pharmacists, clinical researchers, medical informaticists, medical information engineers, etc.). They must conduct a **thorough, in-depth modification and extension** of the configuration files (specifically `src/config.py`, etc.) based on the actual research goals and data characteristics.

Here are the key areas and steps for adapting to real applications:

### 1. Precisely Define the Clinical Problem and Outcomes

- **Specific SAEs:** Clearly and unambiguously define the **specific** serious adverse events you are attempting to predict. Strictly delineate and code these outcome events based on authoritative clinical standards (e.g., a specific grade within CTCAE, a particular combination of diagnosis codes, or a predefined clinical event).
- **Prediction Window:** Determine a prediction time window (`OUTCOME_WINDOW_DAYS`) that is both clinically relevant and feasible. This requires considering the mechanism of occurrence of the target SAE, the duration of relevant treatment regimens, and the intervals and timeliness of clinical monitoring.

### 2. Build High-Quality Clinical NLP Resources

This is the **most time-consuming and critical step** for real-world application, directly determining the quality of information extracted from clinical text.

- **Expand Core Clinical Vocabulary:** Build a comprehensive list of all relevant clinical concepts to serve as a foundational vocabulary, including:
    - Target SAEs and their associated manifestations
    - Relevant medications (study drugs, concomitant medications, etc.)
    - Relevant comorbidities, past medical history, procedures, laboratory tests, physical exam findings, etc. (depending on your specific prediction task)
- **【Most Critical Task】Develop a Robust Terminology Standardization Mapping Table:** This is the **bottleneck and most challenging task** in the entire adaptation process, requiring deep analysis of your specific clinical text data.
    - You must analyze a large sample of clinical notes to identify **all** the different ways clinicians refer to concepts from your core vocabulary in their documentation. This includes: common clinical abbreviations, hospital or department-specific jargon, synonyms or near-synonyms, different levels of detail in descriptions, colloquial expressions, and even common spelling or typing errors.
    - Then, build a **precise mapping table** between these text variations found in real notes and your standardized clinical terms.
    - This process requires **extensive manual annotation, clinical expert review, and continuous iterative refinement**. The **completeness and accuracy** of this mapping table directly determine the coverage and precision of information extraction.
- **Adapt Information Extraction Rules:** Customize or write rules (e.g., for extracting medication dosage, frequency, duration, symptom severity grading, time point information, etc.) to accurately match the specific linguistic patterns and clinical documentation practices used in your notes.
- **Evaluate and Tune NLP Models:** The underlying NLP models used by the framework may have limited effectiveness in recognizing highly specific clinical terminology and contexts.
    - Evaluate their performance in identifying key entities (AEs, Drugs, etc.) on your data.
    - Consider adjusting the labeling scheme used by the framework for entity recognition to better align with your task requirements.
    - If possible, leverage existing pre-trained medical domain NLP models or fine-tune the models on a small, annotated subset of your data.

### 3. Set Clinically Sensible Time Window Parameters

- Based on your clinical understanding of the target SAE's mechanism of occurrence, the duration of relevant treatment regimens, the time-sensitivity of past medical history's influence, etc., reasonably set time-related parameters such as the lookback window (`LOOKBACK_DAYS`, the time range model reviews patient history) and the recent window (`RECENT_WINDOW_DAYS`, used to differentiate recent and distant information and assign different weights). This helps in constructing clinically meaningful time-series features.

### 4. Rigorously Evaluate and Clinically Interpret Prediction Results

- **Clinical Validation is Paramount:** Do not rely solely on technical evaluation metrics (such as AUC, F1 score, precision, recall, etc.). **Clinical experts must independently review** the model's predictions to assess their medical plausibility and consistency and determine if the predicted high-risk patients indeed exhibit high-risk characteristics from a clinical perspective.
- **Enhance Model Explainability:** Use explainability tools (such as SHAP, LIME, etc.) to gain a deep understanding of the **drivers** behind the model's specific predictions. Crucially, verify that the features driving the predictions (especially those extracted from text) are **clinically recognized or plausible risk factors**. Be highly vigilant for the possibility that the model might merely be learning **non-clinical biases, spurious correlations, or data leakage** present in the data, rather than true clinical signals.
